I came with the idea of developing an agnostic web file system that can be installed in any Linux computer. You will be able to mount it in a personal server either cloud, in a Raspi or a NAS and navigate it via web. 

I have tested other options but none of them was fitting 100% my needs so here I am again building my own tools from scratch.
